- Finish creating enums for nuklear's constants
- Clean up the VAO, VBO, and shader program upon cleanup
- get a build working on windows
- Most of pyNuklear's implementation has been driven by porting nuklear's overview.c
  to python, in the file demo/overview.py.  I need help in completing the bindings to
  implement all of overview.c.
  Afterwards, or concurrently, make the python bindings necessary to implement
  calculator.c, node_editor.c, and style.c
